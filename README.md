Project Title: Billing Management System

Overview of the project The Billing Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to automate the billing and checkout process in retail environments. Built as a command-line interface application, it serves as a digital point-of-sale terminal that replaces manual calculations with automated precision. The project allows store administrators or cashiers to browse a pre-defined catalog of products, process customer purchases efficiently, and generate detailed receipts. By simulating real-world retail logic, this system aims to reduce human error, speed up transaction times, and provide a clear record of sales, making it an ideal educational tool for understanding business software logic.

Features The application boasts several core functionalities designed to enhance the user experience. First, it features an extensive Product Catalog Display, which organizes items into categories such as Western wear and Ethnic wear, presenting them clearly to the user upon startup. Second, it utilizes a Dynamic Cart System that allows users to add multiple items to a single transaction using unique product codes. The system also prioritizes data integrity through robust Input Validation, ensuring that invalid product codes or non-numeric quantity inputs do not crash the program but instead prompt the user for correction. Additionally, it offers Real-time Calculation, updating the total cost as items are added. Finally, the Checkout and Receipt Generation feature concludes the session by printing a professional, timestamped summary of all purchased items and the final amount payable.

Technologies/tools used The Billing Management System is engineered entirely using the Python programming language (specifically version 3.x). It leverages Python's standard library, eliminating the need for complex external dependencies or installations. Key technical components include the use of Python dictionaries for efficient data retrieval, list structures for managing dynamic shopping cart contents, and the built-in datetime module for generating accurate transaction timestamps. The interface runs natively in any standard terminal or command prompt environment.

Steps to install & run the project To get started with the Billing Management System, you must first ensure that Python 3 is installed on your computer. Begin by downloading the project source code file (typically named shopping_mall.py or main.py) to a specific folder on your hard drive. Once the file is saved, open your operating system's command line tool (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux). Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file. Finally, execute the program by typing python shopping_mall.py and pressing Enter. The application will initialize immediately and display the product catalog.

Instructions for testing Testing the application is straightforward. Upon running the script, review the displayed list of products and choose a code, such as "WST01". When prompted to enter a product code, type "WST01" and press Enter. Next, the system will ask for a quantity; enter a valid number like "2". You should see a confirmation message indicating the item has been added and the running total updated. To test the error handling, try entering an invalid code (like "XYZ") or a text string (like "three") when asked for a quantity; the system should reject these inputs and ask you to try again. Continue adding different items to build a shopping list. When you are ready to conclude the test, type the specific keyword "BILL" at the product code prompt. The system will stop accepting inputs and generate a final text-based receipt showing the date, time, itemized list, and grand total, confirming the software is working correctly.
